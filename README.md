# weather-app

In this project I create a simple weather app, playing with different API's,
using [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), being able to search
for a location, and see data like temperature, minimum temperature, wind, some
weather description. Also I use
[Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/) for getting a GIF image
related to the current weather. Also I learned to use Babel in this project.
